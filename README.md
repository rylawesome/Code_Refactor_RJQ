# Code_Refactor_RJQ
Simple refactoring of HTML and CSS file

This project sought to simplify a CSS and HTML file, focusing on commenting out sections that were unneeded and fixing broken links.
Majority of the changes made were removing repetition while keeping the code intact in case future changes needed to be made. Main example would be the benefits section, which had 3 seperate classes for 3 sections all doing essentially the same thing. If needed, the code is still there in case one of them needs a background/font change etc., but for now they are commented out for simplification purposes.
